This code book describes the variables used in this project.

The data:
In this course project we deal with data collected from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
Please refer to the website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones for more information on that

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The features from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.
We have the following features:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

But the files present also features that are derived from the above list. Here we are interested in the features that represent 
mean and standard deviation of the measurements.
So, the R script looks for features whose names refers to -mean or -std.
It's really important to point out that some features represent an angle calculation between two vectors, one of them with a -mean
in their names.
Since such features do not represent a mean (they are angles, instead) the R script keeps them out of the data sets.
